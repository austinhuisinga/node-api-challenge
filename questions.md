Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

  Routing and middleware

Describe Middleware?

  I'm Ron Burgundy? -- express wants to keep their file size as small as possible, which means that unless a feature will be used by a large percentage of users, it's not going to be part of the main express dependency. Middleware fills that gap, allowing you to add features into your application a la carte.

Describe a Resource?

  Everything is a resource! They can be be accessed via a unique URI, can have multiple representations. 

What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

  

How can we partition our application into sub-applications?
